# Reverse_Word_Exercise
On Codecademy, I came across a challenge named "Reverse Words" for Python, and wanted to show you my way of approaching the problem with lists and strings.
Although this looks like a pretty easy problem, Codecademy says that this question has been reported to be asked in Google and Facebook interviews. So, I am more than glad to provide a new approach to the challenge.
